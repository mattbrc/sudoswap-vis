# Sudoswap Visualization / Macro Hackathon

This project is built with the sudoswap subgraph [sudoswap subgraph](https://github.com/0xmakesy/Sudoswap) which I forked and deployed to Goerli [here](https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/sudoswap-main/) to thegraph's studio.

## Sudoswap/Macro Bounty:
### Prize Amount
3000 USDC

### Description
We’re looking for projects that can interact with the sudoswap contracts, broadly either in data visualization, or extending the existing protocol’s functionality.

### Acceptance Criteria
A project that focuses on either visualizing an existing aspect of the sudoswap protocol (e.g. trade volume, listed assets, order book depth, etc.) or extending the protocol (e.g. a PartyBid integration, a novel bonding curve, Gnosis safe app to streamline pool creation, etc.)
